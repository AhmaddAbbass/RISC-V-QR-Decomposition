THIS FILE IS ONLY TO TALK About EACH CODE CONTAINS WHAT


1)QR_on_CPP: this represents the whole project on CPP , this step was made to make transitioning to assembly easier

2)Virtual_Cache:This code is an attempt to create a virtual cache by storing some calculations in a well-known place in memory that
we refer to as a virtual cache

3)QR_General_Sizes: This contains the whole project working on any size of matrices by computing the logbase2 of the dimensions 
to perform calculations , it doesn't contain some stuff , but could be added easily.

4)QR_Simple_4x4: This contains everything along with a main that tests a function that represents an Application to QR decompositions
, that functions eventually call every other function hence testing the whole project

5)MATLAB_MSE_and_Verification:  This code was done to perform calculations on large matrices dimensions, and 
verifying identities for the QR decompositons , along with computing the mean squared error resulting from doing the QR decomposition
and then going back to the matrix. A=QR , diff between A and Q*R squared.

6) MATLAB_Parfor:This code was done to perform parallel computations by parfor'ing that does loop unrolling.

7) Testing: Also used to test the project
